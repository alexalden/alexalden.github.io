I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in sociology with a minor in psychology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In the fall of 2015, I entered Northeastern University as a sociology doctorate student. For my research assistantship, I work for the Institute for Health Equity and Social Justice Research (IHESJR) on literacy interventions for mental health service users and evaluation projects. 

Areas of Research/Interest: Mental health services, political-economy, critical race theory, mixed methods

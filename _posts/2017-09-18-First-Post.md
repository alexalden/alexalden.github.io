Introduction
============

My name is Jeff Sternberg and I am a 3rd Year PhD Student in Sociology at Northeastern University. 

I am 26 years old and originally from Plymouth, MI, about half-way between Detroit and Ann Arbor.

My research looks at the way indidivuals live through global economic restructuring, centered around the intersection of the precariat, global cities, mobility, and post-industrial class formation. I am specifcally looking at how the urban nomad section of the precariat adapt themselves to the post-industrial organization of labor, keeping themselves geographically mobile to pivot to every new economic opportunity.

My Self Image

I see myself as a sheep dog because most of the time I am care free.

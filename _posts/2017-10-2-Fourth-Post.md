They have five children, and the family lived as whites in a white suburb. They could not send the children to school, because their birth certificates classified them as Coloured and they would have been refused admission to a white school. This would have begun events that would have led to their exposure, their expulsion from the white suburb, and the loss of their white friends.
Whenever there was a knock at the door during the mornings, she would hide the children at the back of the house, in case it was a school inspector. “We are so frightened,” the mother said. "Everytime there is a knock on the door we think they have come to arrest us.' (They are contravening the Immorality Act by cohabiting.)
The mother said there were frequent family rows as a result of the strain under which they lived. “The final and fatal row came on the morning my son died. In a moment of anger, I threatened to telephone Sonya's parents and tell them he was Coloured. My son walked out of the house and I never saw him alive again. I feel So guilty.'
She also tried to take her life, unsuccessfully. The son, in dying, bequeathed another problem. Because he was Coloured, he could not be buried in a white cemeteryfriends would have asked why he was buried in a Coloured cemetery and the family secret would have been

Robert Coles
I first met John Western in Cape Town, a city whose mixture of natural beauty (I know no place anywhere quite so dramatically appealing) and terrible human tragedy is the subject of this remarkable and important inquiry. The year was 1974; I had come to the city at the invitation of the students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa's oldest educational institution. During my stay in the city, I began to hear, naturally, of the various racially connected injustices that, in sum, are South Africa's exceedingly heavy burdenheavy to the point that one wonders how long it will be until an awful Armageddon is faced by the millions of human beings who live in cities such as Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, and Port Elizabeth, not to mention the countless towns and villages of South Africa. Among the students I met during that rainy August I spent in Cape Town was a rangy and obviously bright and discerning Englishnan who struck me as being brilliantly informed, not only about the People of South Africa and its history and cultural life, but about my Wn, country as well, especially about the difficulties America's blacks and Indians have faced as they have tried to obtain an all too Sive political and economic equity with their powerful, white fellow citizens. sး `မျို° 1974 I have stayed in touch with John Western and his |းမျို African wife, Wendy Western; I have watched a research fiါူ get done, a couple realize how hard it would be for them 蠶 to live in South Africa, and two "foreigners" take up resitionો in the United States and contribute significantly, to its educasets.

Prologue
The phrase "political joy" may strike many readers as close to oxymoronic. Yet to millions of South Africans, this was their experience of the election of April 27 and 28, 1994. They believe, as I do, that South Africa really has turned a corner. However, exploitation, inhumanity, and arrogance have not been banished as if by a magic wand from the beloved country. Far from striding out confidently upon the broad sunlit uplands of democratic liberation, South Africa will for many years be limping toward whatever better future it may envision as its goal, hobbled (though less securely than before) by the ball-andchain of apartheid. South Africans have only just begun to create their new "rainbow nation”. The particular portion of this their collective endeavor at which it is my business to look here is the country's changing urban geography. Why is it that I suspect South Africa's urPan areas are in fact confronting a less than millennial future? Why is it that the "awful legacy of apartheid” will long remain?
These questions may be addressed in the first instance by investiEating how this awful legacy came to be. Such is the topic of Outcast Cape Town. The reader will come to appreciate that the roots of Partheid may be traced back to Cape Town's establishment in the Mwenteenth century, founded as part of that same great Dutch 蠶 trading enterprise that had founded New Amsterdam just a all ov黑 * earlier. Yet apartheid was not inevitable.

ployment. Moreover, the phrase "taken as a whole" papers over the deep divide within the country between Third World majority and First World minority, a divide so sedulously fostered for so long along “racial” fault-lines that by one measure (the Gini coefficient) South Africa had the highest income inequality of any country in the world. To actively dismantle the apartheid city which is so evidently and intendedly reflective and indeed constitutive of this inequality would cost a great deal. The money it would take to pursue social engineering significant enough to somehow rescramble the racial and/or ethnic groups (as formerly defined) seems to make such a prospect utterly remote. A frontal ideologically driven assault on the accreted fabric of the present city-actually knocking large parts of the apartheid city down, or pursuing extensive remodeling-would mean the destruction of shelter in a time of ever-continuing severe housing shortage. And this in a country which is not rich.
No, a more realistic government policy would be to pour resources into low-income, basic public housing. Thus the city would be changed only in areas of new construction, mostly on its periphery. This is indeed one of the main ways in which over four decades the apartheid city was achieved, but it was an enormously demanding and ongoing diversion of energies for the Afrikaner Nationalist governments. To them it was an ideological and strategic commitment of the highest order, for in it they saw one of the hopes for their survival. As a numerical minority, they felt they had to keep the cities mainly White and to put the Black African majority at arm's length, safely under surveillance in controllable, custom-built peripheral townships. Yet even the Nationalists with all their planned Sowetos and Mdantsanes could hardly keep up with the Black demographic realities of rural-urban migration and absolute population increase. At imense cost, they as it were ran as fast as they could, only to stay in the Same place.
It seems unlikely that such expensive schemes for low-income pubhousing will loom so high on the ANC-led government's agenda. hether it be the erosion of the council housing idea in Thatcherite Totalin in the 1980s or the collapse at the end of that decade of “actuY existing socialism" in Eastern Europe and then in the Soviet E".
